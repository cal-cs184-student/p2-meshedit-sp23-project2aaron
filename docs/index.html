<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, I first implemented a way to fit BÃ©zier curves to 2D and 3D surfaces, allowing for the creation of splines to fit arbitrary numbers of points in 2D and 3D space.
    Then I implemented features of meshes, so that flipping edges, splitting edges, normalizing the shading, and upsampling meshes. Together, these two parts resulted in a 3D mesh renderer
    with different features and functionalities. I learned that drawing Bezier curves is a recursive operation by nature, and that upsampling meshes is not as straightforward or consistent as
    one might hope. These provided a lot more insight into how the geometry of 3D objects are rendered in computer graphics.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm involves recursively using lerps to reduce n points into n-1 points, approximating a curve between any number of points. Once n is reduced to 1, that point is added to the curve and system of equations used to solve for it.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm involves converting a list of vectors into a single vector. By treating a 3D space as a set of row vectors, we can apply de Casteljau's algorithm to each row to receive a single point. Once each row is reduced to a single point, the entire space is reduced to a single column vector, which can then be fed into de Casteljau's algorithm again to receive one point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    For each face, I traversed through all 3 points on the triangle and used the cross product to find the normal vector and area of each respsective triangle. Then I summed up the normal vectors scaled by the areas for all neighboring triangles and normalized the resulting vector, resulting in a normal vector for the vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I followed the directions and identified and assigned a variable to every element in the mesh. Then I drew out the resulting flipped mesh and all the new elements and their assignmnents, and went through the conveniently named variables and assigned each of them to their rightful value.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    I was fortunate enough that my thorough approach did not necessitate a debugging journey. After my first attempt, I noticed some faces disappearing, but after rereading the spec I realized that I needed to reassign the halfedges of the faces and vertices, which I proceeded to do and resolved my problems.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I largely followed the same procedure as Edge Flip, particularly in the first half where I labeled and assigned variables to all the existing mesh elements. Then I created each new element I would need (3 edges, 6 half edges, 2 faces, and 1 vertex) and rigorously set all the fields for each one.

<p>
    Once again, I briefly encountered disappearing faces. I noted that the face seemed to be in the position of one I had named "f4," so I checked my halfedge assignments and noticed I typed the wrong one. Upon correcting this, my code functioned fine.
</p>
<br>

<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented loop subdivision by first iterating through all the vertices and calculating their newPositions based on the surrounding positions. Once that was stored, I did the same for the edges and the newPositions of the vertices to be created. Then I iterated through all the original edges and split them, making sure to exclude any new edges made along the way. Then I iterated over all the edges again, including the new ones, and flipped them only if they were new edges connecting a new and old vertex. Then I updated the newPosition of all the vertices and made sure to set each edge and vertex's isNew field to false.
</p>

<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    When upsampling, I observed that the mesh becomes more finely grained and well distributed after loop subdivision. However, sharper corners and edges become increasingly dense as loop subdivision is increased, as evidenced by the screenshots below:
</p>
<div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr align="center">
            <td>
                <img src="images/upsample.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption>Upsampled twice</figcaption>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="images/upsamplezoom.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
                <figcaption>Sharp Corners</figcaption>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>
    By pre-flipping, it's possible to address over-crowding somewhat. In the below image, some of the tiles which were preflipped result in a less crowded corner, although only marginally. However splitting does not address this issue, as it only results in more overall mesh parts.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    Although it's not initially visible, the initial cube actually is asymmetrical - each vertex has a different amounts of neighboring vertices.
    The result is when loop subdivision occurs, the rightmost upper corner in the back's position doesn't update, as it only has 3 neighboring vertices.
    This is not remedied by further loop subdivision, but compounded, as that particular point maintains it's 3 neighboring vertices and stays in place.
</p>

    <table style="width:100%">
        <tr align="center">
            <td>

        </tr>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>
    By pre-flipping the edges to cause the cube to be symmetrical on all sides (orienting the cross-edges to be the same), we can address this.
